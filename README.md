This is a clock with the time reference created with a 10Mhz OCXO. It (of course) have a perpetual calendar.
It has 14 pieces of 7-segment LED displays to show Hours, minutes, seconds, date, month and year. It also have 7 Light emitting diodes for the calculated day of the week.
All inputs is taken care of by a rotary encoder
It uses an Ardoino Mini Pro (5V 16Mhz) to drive the whole thing. The PCB is rather complicated. Therefore I have it manufactured by "JLCPCB".
Everything is here to study, use or misuse in anyway you may like.
All files including the Arduino code is to be found in the zip-file "Files".
